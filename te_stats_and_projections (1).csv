Is that good? It seems good. Kelce continued his dominance last season by finishing as a top-13 fantasy TE every week other than 17. Kelce has finished no lower than second at the position in routes, targets, receptions and yardage each of the past three seasons. His touchdowns fell from 10 in 2018 to five in 2019, but his 7.3 OTD (second-highest) and nine end zone targets (fourth) suggest he was actually unlucky in that area. Kelce has never finished a season outside the top 10 in YPT and remains one of Patrick Mahomes' top targets. The 30-year-old is worth a look in Round 2."
2,George Kittle,49ers,TE,107,85,1053,12.4,5,5,22,0,222.5,120.3,116,84,1035,12.3,7,5,17,0,231.77,117.14,"Kittle wasn't much of a factor as a pass-catcher during the 49ers' Super Bowl run (8-71-0 in three games), but don't let that overshadow what was another dominant regular season. Kittle followed up his breakout 2018 season with an 85-1053-5 receiving line in 14 games in 2019. Kittle has finished no lower than fourth in targets, receptions, yardage, RAC or fantasy points each of the past two seasons. One area where Kittle has underwhelmed is touchdowns (five each of the past two seasons) and his 10.8 OTD and 13 end zone targets during the span suggest it's not a fluke. Of course, there's still plenty of room to grow in that department, and Kittle has plenty of dominant years left at age 26. He's a fine third-round target."
3,Zach Ertz,Eagles,TE,135,88,916,10.4,6,0,0,0,215.6,113.4,117,78,821,10.5,7,0,0,0,201.16,86.53,"Ertz had his hands full playing through injuries and double coverage last season, but the veteran tight end still managed his third consecutive campaign as a top-four fantasy tight end. Ertz hasn't finished lower than fifth in targets, sixth in receptions or seventh in yardage at the position since 2014. He's also ranked no lower than fourth in touchdowns and OTD each of the past three seasons. Third-year Dallas Goedert is looming, but Ertz enters his age-29 season as Carson Wentz's top target and remains a top-five fantasy tight end."
4,Mark Andrews,Ravens,TE,98,64,852,13.3,10,0,0,0,207.2,105,103,66,878,13.4,8,0,0,0,199.44,84.81,"A 2018 third-round pick, Andrews exited his rookie campaign seemingly set to become one of the league's next great tight ends. It's fair to say he delivered the goods in 2019. Despite ranking 40th at the position in snaps, Andrews handled a massive 25% target share for Baltimore's league-best offense en route to a TE5 fantasy campaign. Andrews' 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the entire league. That helped him to 10 touchdowns. Andrews' has ranked no lower than fifth in aDOT or YPR during his two pro seasons. Lamar Jackson's top target enters his age-24 season as a solid TE1 option."

Waller was drafted in the sixth round of the 2015 draft as a 6-foot-6 wide receiver. He barely saw the field while dealing with addiction but got back on his feet as a tight end with the Raiders. An absolute force from the get-go, Waller finished no lower than fourth among tight ends in snaps, routes, targets, receptions, yardage or YPT. Waller was held to three touchdowns (3.9 OTD) but finished third in fantasy points. The 27-year-old is Derek Carr's top target and positioned well for another high-volume season. He's a top-five fantasy tight end."

The injuries have held Engram without a top-12 fantasy campaign since 2017, but there's no doubt he's been a major force when healthy. Engram was one of six players who appeared in at least eight games and were targeted at least six times during 100% of those outings last season. The consistent usage helped him to five top-10 fantasy weeks in eight tries (the position's fourth-best rate). We have to knock him a bit for durability concerns, but Engram is still in his prime at age 25 and should be locked into lineups when active."
7,Tyler Higbee,Rams,TE,89,69,734,10.6,3,0,0,0,160.4,58.2,93,64,704,10.9,5,0,0,0,162.76,48.13,"If someone told you midway through the 2019 season that Higbee was a solid TE1 fantasy option going forward, you would've laughed. The 2016 fourth-round pick had totaled an 86-884-5 receiving line in 58 games through Week 12 of last season. He went on to produce a 43-522-2 line while averaging 11.4 targets per game the rest of the season. Higbee was the top-scoring fantasy TE by 23 points during the span. The 27-year-old signed a contract extension last year and Sean McVay's adjustment to more '12' personnel late last season suggests Higbee's emergence was no fluke. Higbee is best-viewed as mid-range TE1."
8,Jared Cook,Saints,TE,65,43,705,16.4,9,0,0,0,167.5,65.3,71,46,656,14.2,6,0,0,0,149.77,35.14,"After failing to post a single fantasy campaign better than 12th during his first eight NFL seasons, Cook has posted a pair of top-seven finishes (and with different teams) over the past two seasons. Cook missed a pair of games last season, but managed a TE7 campaign thanks to nine touchdowns (his 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the league) and elite efficiency (he posted the position's highest aDOT, YPR and YPT). Cook is now 33 years old, but his role as one of Drew Brees' primary targets remains secure. Consider him a borderline top-10 fantasy option."
9,Rob Gronkowski,Buccaneers,TE,,,,,,,,,0,-102.2,77,52,694,13.5,5,0,0,0,149.71,35.08,"Gronk is back! The longtime Patriots' superstar ended his retirement and was traded to the Buccaneers, where he'll reunite with his former quarterback Tom Brady. Gronkowski sat out last season after ending 2018 with his seventh fantasy finish of 11th or better in nine NFL seasons. When healthy, effectiveness has never been an issue for Gronkowski (he has never played a season in which he was lower than seventh among tight ends in yards per target or yards per reception), but durability has been an issue (he hasn't appeared in a full 16-game regular season since 2011).'Gronkowski is unlikely to re-emerge as an elite fantasy option, but he's in a good enough situation to allow mid-to-back-end TE1 numbers."
10,Hunter Henry,Chargers,TE,76,55,652,11.9,5,0,0,0,150.2,48,82,54,650,12,4,0,0,0,145.51,30.88,"Henry is back with the Chargers after the team applied the franchise tag during the offseason. The team's 2016 second-round pick has yet to play a full 16-game season, missing all of 2018 and a total of seven games the other three seasons. That includes four in 2019, though Henry was productive enough when active to produce his first top-10 fantasy campaign. Henry has finished top-10 in YPT in all three of his NFL seasons and has been a force near the goal line, with 17 touchdowns and 25 end zone targets in 41 games. Henry's durability woes and the departure of Philip Rivers are concerns, but the 25-year-old will still be a back-end TE1 option when active."
11,Hayden Hurst,Falcons,TE,39,30,349,11.6,2,0,0,0,76.9,-25.3,79,54,623,11.5,4,0,0,0,142.84,28.21,"Hurst was traded to the Falcons following two seasons as a situational player in Baltimore. Atlanta will look to the 2018 first-round pick as a replacement for Austin Hooper. Hurst posted a modest 30-349-2 receiving line off the bench last season, but his efficiency was great. He ranked sixth at tight end in both catch rate (77%) and YPT (8.9). Hurst has yet to eclipse a 58% snap share in 30 career games, but he figures to operate as a full-time, two-way tight end in a pass-heavy Atlanta offense that helped Hooper to back-to-back TE1 campaigns. Hurst is obviously a bit risky, but the 26-year-old is well-positioned for a breakout. Consider him a mid-range TE2."
12,T.J. Hockenson,Lions,TE,59,32,367,11.5,2,0,0,0,80.7,-21.5,83,54,621,11.5,4,0,0,0,142.67,28.04,"It's rare for a rookie tight end to make much noise in fantasy, so Hockenson's 32-367-2 line after being selected eighth overall in the 2019 draft should not be viewed as a knock. The Iowa product showed his upside with a 6-131-1 showing in his NFL debut, but managed double-digit fantasy points in only one additional game and missed the final four games due to injury. The 23-year-old is a strong bet for more work in his second season and, as usual for second-year tight ends, will come fairly cheap in the double-digit rounds. Hockenson has the upside to become one of the next great all-around tight ends."
13,Noah Fant,Broncos,TE,66,40,562,14.1,3,3,-12,0,111,8.8,80,54,614,11.4,4,2,7,0,141.64,27.01,"The Broncos selected Fant in the first round of last year's draft and proceeded to put him on the field for 68% of their offensive snaps. That's a healthy number for a 21-year-old rookie, as was Fant's TE16 fantasy campaign. The Iowa product was a game-changer with the ball in his hands, pacing 41 qualified tight ends with an 8.3 RAC. His 562 receiving yards rank sixth and his 8.9 YPT fifth among rookie tight ends since 2007. Fant's usage actually declined quite a bit in December, but there's little doubt he's a strong candidate for a big second-year leap as one of Drew Lock's top targets. Fant has elite upside and should be on your radar in the middle rounds."

The 2016 third-round pick has finished no lower than seventh among tight ends in routes, targets, receptions or receiving yards each of the past two seasons. He posted career-high marks in targets (96), receptions (75), receiving yards (787) and touchdowns (six) last season despite missing three games and was fantasy's top-scoring tight end prior to suffering an injury in Week 10. Hooper's stock takes hit as he trades Matt Ryan and Atlanta's pass-heavy offense for Baker Mayfield and a Browns offense that also include David Njoku. Hooper enters his age-25 season as a borderline top-10 fantasy option."

We got a glimpse of what that could look like late last season as Doyle tied for the team lead with 31 targets (20% share) once Ebron went on IR after Week 12. Doyle was held to two top-10 fantasy weeks and one finish better than eighth on the season, but there are reasons for optimism. Coach Frank Reich's tight end units have never combined for a target share below 23% in six seasons as a coach/OC. Also, new QB Philip Rivers made heavy usage of Antonio Gates and Hunter Henry in recent years with the Chargers. Doyle, who ranked sixth at tight end with eight end zone targets last season, should be viewed as a fringe top-15 fantasy TE in his age-30 season."

The Jets selected Herndon in the fourth round of the 2018 draft and quickly put him in position for a big role. The Miami product was on the field for 63% of New York's snaps and, following a slow start, was fantasy's No. 9 tight end from Week 6 on. His 10.3 aDOT was fifth-highest at the position and helped him to a strong 9.0 YPT (10th). Herndon's 502 receiving yards rank 12th, his catch rate 12th, his YPT fourth and his aDOT second among rookie tight ends since 2007. Herndon is an excellent post-hype target and positioned well for a breakout."

The 2018 second-round pick finished the season third among tight ends in pass routes and ranked no lower than 12th in targets, receptions, receiving yards or touchdowns. Gesicki's 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the entire league. His 58% catch rate was ugly, but his role as a seam-stretcher (10.1 aDOT) and shaky quarterback accuracy (22% off target rate) were the primary culprits. Gesicki has yet to drop a pass on 120 targets and was fantasy's TE12 in 2019. He's a candidate for another leap forward and a borderline TE1 option."

The 2014 first-round pick underachieved during his time with the Lions, but a breakout season in 2018 saw him post a 66-750-13 receiving line. He crashed back to earth last season thanks to predictable regression to the mean, but also due to the loss of Andrew Luck, posting a 31-375-3 line in 11 games. Now with Pittsburgh, the 27-year-old figures to work ahead of Vance McDonald as the team's top receiving tight end. Ebron is best-viewed as a mid-to-back-end TE2."

A big reason for the high-end production was a massive number of injuries to Eagles' wide receivers and that shows up in Goedert's splits. The 2018 second-round pick posted five top-10 fantasy weeks, but four came after the team's Week 10 bye. Goedert appears to have a bright future, but the 25-year-old will struggle for TE1 numbers barring an Ertz injury. Goedert is, however, one of the best handcuffs in fantasy."

Granted it was on 43 targets, but Smith's 2019 season was highly efficient. He ranked no lower than second at the position in catch rate (81%), YPT (10.2) or RAC (7.9). The Titans appear committed to manufacturing touches for the versatile Smith, as 19% of his targets came on screens and he also handled four carries. Of course, the usage has yet to allow much fantasy success. Most of Smith's work has come near the line of scrimmage (5.7 aDOT) and very little has come near the end zone (eight touchdowns, six end zone targets in career). Smith is a back-end TE2."

Jarwin has yet to post a top-25 fantasy campaign, but he showed what he can offer with a 7-119-3 receiving line in Week 17 of the 2018 season. He's been efficient on 77 career targets, with a healthy 75% catch rate and 8.7 YPT. He's unlikely to rise higher than fourth in line for targets, but Dallas' high-scoring offense makes Jarwin worthy of a late-round flier."

The 2019 second-round pick played a healthy 587 snaps, but was a clear second to Kyle Rudolph (749 snaps) on the depth chart and was primarily utilized as short-area target (5.9 aDOT). Rudolph out-targeted Smith 49 to 48, though Smith is a strong bet to take over as the team's top receiving threat at the position in his second season. Smith is still extremely young (he's entering his age-22 season), but especially with Stefon Diggs gone, he's well-positioned for a step forward.

The 33-year-old isn't the fantasy force he was during his prime years in New Orleans and Seattle and is coming off his worst statistical season since his rookie year. Graham played 55% of the snaps, handled a 12% target share and posted a 38-447-3 receiving line despite appearing in all 16 of Green Bay's regular-season games.

Sternberger didn't make his NFL debut until Week 9 due to injury and was limited to 60 regular-season snaps, but he went on to play a larger role during a pair of playoff games. Aaron Rodgers has rarely relied much on his tight end, but the athletic 6-foot-4, 251-pound Sternberger should land in TE2 territory if he earns a starting gig.

He flashed in an expanded role during the final five weeks of 2018 (25-246-2), but wasn't nearly as productive in the same situation last season (15-132-1). Thomas finished dead last among qualified tight ends in catch rate (53%), YPT (4.5) and drop rate (10.0%), though a position-high 27% of balls thrown his way were off-target.

The combination of plenty of downfield routes (his 9.2 aDOT ranked sixth) and Josh Allen's inaccuracy (20% off-target rate ranked ninth) led to an ugly 56% catch rate (second-worst), but Knox still managed a respectable 7.8 YPT (14th-best).

Eifert finished TE19 in fantasy, which marked his first top-20 campaign since 2015. New Jaguars OC Jay Gruden makes heavy use of his tight ends (career 23% target share), which benefits Eifert and second-year TE Josh Oliver. Of course, we still need to be wary of Eifert's durability after he missed 52 of 80 possible games during the 2014-18 seasons. Eifert is a fringe TE2 at best."

He was TE13 in fantasy, though it could've been better if not for bad touchdown luck (2 TD, 4.7 OTD). Olsen is now 35 and, while his move to Seattle could allow early-season fantasy relevance, it is expected that Will Dissly will return to the lineup at some point this calendar year.

He caught six touchdowns during the 2019 regular season, but those six came on seven targets inside the 10-yard line, which is obviously unsustainable. Hill's role allowed him no fantasy value when designiated as a QB (one weekly finish better than 18th), but his 2019 point total would've ranked 21st at tight end.

McDonald wasn't a fantasy factor as a short-range target, having posted a 4.3 aDOT (second-lowest) and 7.2 YPR (lowest).
