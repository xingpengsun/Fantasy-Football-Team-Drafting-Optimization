    "Fantasy football is a widely played game in America where a set of league “owners” draft actual National Football League players to their fantasy teams and accrue points each week based on the on-field performance of those players. A common format of drafting fantasy teams is the snake draft. This means each owner is randomly given a pick number which is the order they draft in. This order flips for every round of the draft (so the owner that picked last in the previous round picks first in the next round). Our group is trying to use an optimization model to draft the highest scoring fantasy football team possible based on the number of points each player is projected to score at the beginning of the year. This model will be designed to determine the highest value player available for each round of a snake fantasy draft based on the currently available players and the players the team has already drafted.\n",

    "The data we used in our model was found on Kaggle. It contains ESPN's 2019 fantasy football statistics and 2020 fantasy football player projections. The data is divided into position groups. We used player name and 2020 point projections for our model.\n",

    "To more accurately determine each player's value, we used a metric called value over replacement player (VORP). This metric is used to measure how many points a particular player is predicted contribute to the team over a replacement-level player of the same position. For this application, we used the player that is predicted to be picked last in each position group as the replacement player. Since we are assuming that this draft is for a 10 team league, we chose the the 10th ranked kicker and defense, 20th ranked quarterback and tight end, and the 50th ranked running back and wide receiver as our replacement players. To get each player's VORP, we simply take their 2020 points prediction from ESPN and subtract the points prediction from the replacement-level player in their position group."
