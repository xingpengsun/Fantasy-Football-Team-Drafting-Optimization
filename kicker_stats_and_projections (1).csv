1,Harrison Butker,K,Chiefs,18,19,13,13,3,6,34,38,45,48,162,38,16,16,8,10,3,5,26,31,49,51,138.35,14.3,"Butker earned the nickname 'Butt kicker' from his coach Andy Reid during a rookie season in which he finished seventh at the position in fantasy points. He progressed to fifth place in 2018 before pacing the position in total fantasy points and top-10 weeks (11) last season. Butler led the NFL in both attempts (38) and conversions (34) in 2019. In fact, the Chiefs have finished top-nine in field goal attempts in four of the past five seasons. Kansas City's elite offense should help Butker sustain top-end fantasy production."
2,Wil Lutz,K,Saints,16,16,13,15,3,5,32,36,48,49,159,35,16,16,8,10,3,5,27,31,46,48,136.7,12.65,"Lutz has emerged as one of the 'safest' bets at kicker with four consecutive top-seven fantasy campaigns to begin his career. That includes a pair of top-three campaigns during each of the past two seasons. Only Harrison Butker outscored him last season, and Lutz actually matched him with a league-high 11 top-10 fantasy weeks. Not just a product of opportunity, Lutz's distance-adjusted field goal percentage is third best in the league over the past two seasons. The high-scoring Saints kicker is a top fantasy option."
3,Justin Tucker,K,Ravens,17,17,10,11,1,1,28,29,57,59,152,28,16,16,8,10,3,5,27,30,43,44,134.67,10.62,"It doesn't get much more volatile than kickers in fantasy football, but Tucker remains one of the exceptions. The opera-singing superstar has finished no lower than 11th in fantasy points during his eight seasons in the league, which includes four-consecutive top-four finishes. He has accomplished that even with the Ravens ranking 20th in field goal attempts last season (the team's first finish lower than 12th since 2010), though they were first in extra point attempts. Tucker has nailed a league-best 91.3% (168 of 184) of his field goals and a league-best 98.4% (188 of 191) of extra points since 2015. The league's best kicker working in a high-scoring offense, Tucker should be the first kicker drafted."
4,Matt Prater,K,Lions,13,14,6,9,7,8,26,31,35,36,128,4,16,17,8,10,3,5,27,32,38,40,130.3,6.25,"Prater just continues to get the job done. Five of his past eight seasons have resulted in a top-10 fantasy campaign, including three of the past four. Once adjusted for distance, Prater trails only Justin Tucker in field goal accuracy over the past five seasons. He has been cash money from deep, converting on 47 of 61 attempts from 50-plus yards over the past decade; that 77.0% rate is tops in the league during that span. Prater is entering his age-36 season but remains a solid fantasy starter in a Lions offense that figures to improve with a healthy Matthew Stafford."
5,Robbie Gould,K,49ers,17,19,6,8,0,4,23,31,41,42,108,-16,16,17,8,10,3,5,26,32,39,42,126.08,2.03,"Gould is back with the NFC Champion 49ers after a 2019 campaign that saw him stumble to 17th in fantasy points. That was quite the step back for a player who had finished his previous three full seasons as a top-seven fantasy kicker. It's fair to wonder if age is becoming a factor for the 37-year-old, as last season's 74.2% field goal percentage was the worst of his career, though perhaps it was a fluke after he paced the league at 96.5% over the previous three seasons. Despite the down year, Gould should be viewed as a solid fantasy starter in a Niners' offense that has ranked no lower than seventh in field goal attempts in each of the past three seasons."
6,Chris Boswell,K,Steelers,19,19,9,10,1,2,29,31,28,28,124,0,16,16,7,10,3,5,26,31,38,40,124.72,0.67,"Boswell is the epitome of kickers in fantasy football, having finished 22nd or worse twice and 10th or better twice during the past four seasons. That includes a 10th-place finish in 2019 in which the Steelers' kicker managed nine top-10 weeks (fifth most). Boswell didn't miss an extra point and converted on 93.5% of 31 field goal attempts last season, which was third best in the league. Boswell has been an above-average kicker in all four of his healthy NFL seasons and, especially with Ben Roethlisberger back, the 29-year-old can be viewed as a starter in fantasy."

His 10 top-10 fantasy weeks also ranked fourth. The red flag here is that Gay's production was volume based, as his 35 field goal attempts tied for fourth and his 48 extra points attempts ranked third. He ranked near the bottom of the league in both field goal (77.1%) and extra point (89.6%) conversion rate. Perhaps Gay's accuracy will improve in his second season, and Tampa Bay's offense should allow plenty of opportunities with Tom Brady under center. Gay is a borderline fantasy starter."

Fantasy's top-scoring kicker back in 2017, 'Greg the Leg' has finished just outside the top 10 in each of the past two seasons. Zuerlein's accuracy has been all over the place throughout his career. He nailed 95.0% of his field goals in 2017, but fell to 87.1% in 2018 and a horrific 72.7% last season. On the plus side, Zuerlein was one of only a handful of kickers who didn't miss an extra point last season, and Dallas has finished among the top five in field goal attempts in each of the past two seasons. The 32-year-old is worth a flier in the last round."

In what was his first full season with Arizona, Gonzalez produced 11 top-10 fantasy weeks, which tied for most. His 35 field goal attempts were third most in the league and, though his 88.6% field goal percentage was eighth best, it was certainly inflated by an average distance of 33.5 yards, which was the shortest in the league. Arizona's offense is a candidate for a leap in quarterback Kyler Murray's second season, which makes Gonzalez a fine last-round flier."

The 26-year-old was the top-scoring kicker in 2018, but he crashed back to earth with a 19th-place finish in 2019. Fairbairn's fall was pretty dramatic, as his accuracy plummeted from 88.1% in 2018 to 80.0% in 2019 on field goals and 95.1% in 2018 to 88.9% in 2019 on extra points. Houston also fell from second to 29th in field goal attempts. Houston clearly isn't worried after signing Fairbairn to a four-year extension during the offseason. Fairbairn is a fine pick in the final round of your draft."
